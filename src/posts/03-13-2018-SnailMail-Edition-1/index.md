Dear Extended Slow Ventures Community,

Welcome to the first edition of Slow Snailmail… a bi weekly-ish newsletter from the team at Slow Ventures where we will feature ideas, and themes we think are particularly interesting and fun - as well as longer-form content from great members of the community.

First - If you are reading this first edition, you are here because you are a Slow Ventures portfolio company team member, LP, founder, or a member of the community connected to Slow.  If you don’t want this communique in the future, zero hard feelings - we understand, we get a lot of email as well - feel free to unsubscribe and we won’t bother you going forward.

Second, why we are doing this.  The goal in starting Snailmail is to set a forum for sharing interesting ideas in a de-pressured setting over the internet (if that is even possible anymore)...

We are doing this because a few years ago we started hosting BBQs for members of the Slow community from time to time.  They ended up being really really fun particularly because they were un-structured, inexpensive, casual, and encouraged odd and interesting conversations beyond the usual event prattle about valuations and tech stacks simply by being relaxed.

The BBQs oddly reminded many of us of some of the best aspects of how much more relaxed and fun the technology community used to feel, back when we were first getting involved ~15-20 years ago ...  and it put in stark relief how the technology industry broadly, and Silicon Valley in particular - for all its advances -, has become pretty un-fun and in many ways less intellectually interesting than it was in the past.

With huge amounts of money and global power so clearly at stake and the eye of Sauron watching - in a way that was not so apparent a decade or more ago - it is understandable why people have become so much more careful about what they say, the ideas they engage with, how they spend their time, and the front they put up.  But we believe that all those trappings means that lots of great ideas, relationships, and conversations are missed - and things are left un-said and un-explored.

Great things come out of more lose, free, fun time with a great community where you don’t have to be quite so buttoned up and can share half baked, quirky ideas, etc.

The problem - of course - is that BBQs don’t scale….So hope with Snailmail is to do something that feels similar, but scales better.

This newsletter, unlike many others, isn’t going to try to be polished all the time…. We will have typos and write in fragments — if you only want the polished bits wait for our LP letters.

We will probably share bad ideas and silly jokes.  We will probably get in trouble at some point for sharing silly jokes or bad ideas (don’t worry, most of the partners are used to being publicly shamed on the internet from time to time - we are good at apologizing when we are wrong) … but the idea is to set a stage for people who want to share what they are working on, passions, themes, considerations, and dare I say even proposals.

So, It is going to be … interesting :)

If you know others who might enjoy or get value from this - anyone can sign up here.

If you want to share something written / podcasted / video-ed / whatever just reply to the newsletter…. we will actively monitor replies and the whole idea is to enable our community to reach each other.  We can’t promise to publish everything, but we will respond and engage with you on whatever you send.

With that - welcome! And we hope you enjoy going forward!

— The Slow Team

#### 🤔 Short Thoughts & Novelties:

* [Jim Carrey on brain health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTblbYqQQag)  is worth your time.

* [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon)  might be the most important person of the 20th century that almost no one has heard of. If you are short for time read this [Medium post](https://medium.com/the-mission/10-000-hours-with-claude-shannon-12-lessons-on-life-and-learning-from-a-genius-e8b9297bee8f) . If you got a few hours read the book [A Mind at Play](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Play-Shannon-Invented-Information/dp/1476766681) .
* Is Compound Interest Destroying the World? Einstein famously said that compound interest was the eighth wonder of the world “he who understands it, earns it… he who doesn’t pays it”.  It is worth considering however that the tendency towards disequilibrium driven by compound interest & accelerated by technology is the center of our modern societal woes.
* Brain Health feels like it is going more and more mainstream - and the VC community seems to be taking notice. Our partner Dave Morin has focused on it for some time - and he has also gone completely down the yoga rabbit hole - which has been [changing his genes](http://time.com/4822302/yoga-meditation-genes-stress/) .
* [The Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) .  If you want to understand most company disfunction, look no further…  HT Bobby Goodlatte - how did we not know about this sooner!
